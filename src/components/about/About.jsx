                    I have been involved in both teamwork and individual 
                    roles in the projects I have contributed to. 
                    I followed Agile methodology during this time. 
                    I participated a web development bootcamp and successfully completed it. 
                    My journey in Front-End development continues 
                    by learning new concepts and developing new applications. 
                    I also review projects on GitHub to make my projects cleaner and 
                    to improve my skills.
